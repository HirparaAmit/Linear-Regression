# Linear-Regression

I covered all theory concepts, mathemetical concepts with images and code in `.ipynb` file itself.

You just need to read `.ipynb` file and you get all stuff about Linear Regression.

Note : You probably find some code cells without their outputs. For that you need to download `.ipynb` file and run it by yourself.
