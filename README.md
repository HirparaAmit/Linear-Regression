# Linear-Regression

I covered all theory concepts, mathemetical concepts with images and code in `.ipynb` file itself.

You just need to read `.ipynb` file and you get all stuff about Linear Regression.

Note : You probably find some code cells without their outputs. For that you need to download `.ipynb` file and run it by yourself. 

I also create one project on Linear regression using Pytorch from scratch. So if you want to see that go on:
